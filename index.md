# **Excel Explainer: VLOOKUP**
**By: Eythan Jenkins**

## What is VLOOKUP
Excel's VLOOKUP tool is a search function for "when you need to find things in a table or a range by row." (support.microsoft.com) Essentially, you give VLOOKUP input, Excel searches for that input in the chart, and finally it will give you the value associated with that input. I like to think of it as being similar to a hash table or dictionary: you provide the VLOOKUP function with your 'key', and it returns the 'value' of that key.

## Why to use VLOOKUP
A search function like VLOOKUP makes it easy to find values fast within an Excel sheet. Instead of having to maually navigate the sheet for your data of interest, you can simply search up the term you are looking for, and the value will be returned to you.
